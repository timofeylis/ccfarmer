# ccfarmer
Fun little farming robot programmed in lua for the computercraft mod in minecraft. There were some fixes made after I saved this, but I can't find the updated file
The first two specified values are the columns and rows of the farm, and the bot assumes it starts directly behind the bottom left block of the farm. It has a "seed" mode in which the bot locates and uses seeds in its inventory in order to plant the farm, and a default mode in which it checks each block for the crop's harvestability status, and replaces any broken crops. The bot also automatically locates and uses and fuel in its inventory.
